# Business Permit System

Web-based Business Permit System that streamlines application, assessment, approval, and renewal workflows.

This repository contains a PHP + JavaScript application designed to manage the lifecycle of business permit requests: from applicant submission, through assessment and approval, to renewal processes. It is intended to be installed on a standard LAMP/LEMP stack or run locally for development.

---

## Key Features

- Applicant-facing application submission (forms, file uploads)
- Assessment and review workflows for staff
- Approval and permit issuance
- Renewal handling and status tracking
- Notification hooks (email config recommended)
- Role-based access (applicants, reviewers/assessors, administrators)
- Front-end interactions implemented with JavaScript and styling via CSS

> Languages: PHP, JavaScript, CSS (primary); some Hack code may be present.

---

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4+ (8.0+ recommended)
- Web server (Apache, Nginx) or PHP built-in server for development
- MySQL / MariaDB (or compatible RDBMS)
- Composer (if composer.json exists and project uses dependencies)
- Node.js + npm/yarn (only if frontend assets need building)
- Git (for cloning repository)

---

## Quick start (development)

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/01gem/Business-Permit-System.git
   cd Business-Permit-System
   ```

2. Install PHP dependencies (if used)
   ```
   composer install
   ```
   If the project does not have composer dependencies, this step may be skipped.

3. Install frontend dependencies and build assets (if applicable)
   ```
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
   Or use `yarn` if preferred. If the repo contains no package.json, skip this.

4. Configuration
   - Copy the example environment/config file and update it with your settings:
     ```
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
     Edit `.env` (or the config files used by the project) and set:
     - Database host, name, user, password
     - Base URL (APP_URL)
     - Mail settings (SMTP) for notifications
     - File storage paths and permissions

   - If the repo does not include an `.env.example`, create the configuration according to the project's config files (e.g., config.php).

5. Create the database
   - Create a blank database in MySQL/MariaDB:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE business_permit CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
     ```
   - Import the provided SQL schema (if the repository includes `database/schema.sql` or similar):
     ```
     mysql -u DB_USER -p business_permit < database/schema.sql
     ```
     If there are migration scripts or an installer in the repo, follow those instead.

6. File permissions
   - Ensure any storage/uploads/logs directories are writable by the web server user:
     ```
     chown -R www-data:www-data storage uploads logs
     chmod -R 755 storage uploads logs
     ```
     Adjust user/group as needed for your environment.

7. Serve the application
   - Using PHP built-in server (development only):
     ```
     php -S localhost:8000 -t public
     ```
     Or point your web server document root to the project's public directory (commonly `public/` or the project root if there is a single `index.php`).

8. Visit the app in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
   or the configured domain.

## Typical Workflows

- Applicant:
  - Register or proceed as guest (depending on app configuration)
  - Complete application form and upload required documents
  - Track application status (submitted → under assessment → approved/declined → issued)

- Staff / Assessor:
  - View incoming applications
  - Add assessment notes, request additional documents, or forward for inspection
  - Approve or decline applications, trigger notifications

- Administrator:
  - Manage users and roles
  - Configure permit types, fees, expiry periods
  - View reports and audit logs

Note: Exact screens, roles, and transitions depend on the implementation in this repository.

## Environment & Production Recommendations

- Use a production-ready web server (Nginx/Apache) with PHP-FPM
- Use HTTPS (TLS)
- Restrict file upload types and scan uploaded files
- Configure strong database credentials and limit remote access
- Backup database regularly and keep file uploads backed up
- Set appropriate PHP settings (error reporting off in production)
- Use environment variables (not checked-in secrets) for credentials

---

## Troubleshooting

- Blank pages or HTTP 500: Check PHP error logs and ensure display_errors is off in production
- Database connection errors: Verify DB host/port/credentials and that the DB server is running
- Permission issues with uploads: Ensure web server user can write to upload/storage folders
- Missing assets: Run `npm install` and `npm run build` if front-end assets are built

---

## Testing

If tests are provided in the repository (e.g., PHPUnit or JS test suites), run them with the standard commands:

- PHP tests (if present):
  ```
  ./vendor/bin/phpunit
  ```
- JavaScript tests (if present):
  ```
  npm test
  ```

If the repo does not contain tests, consider adding unit and integration tests for critical flows (application submission, assessment transitions, authentication).
